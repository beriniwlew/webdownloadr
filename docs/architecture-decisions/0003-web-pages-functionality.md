# 0003: Web Pages Functionality Implementation

Status: Accepted  
Date: 2024-01-15  
Supersedes: N/A

## Context

The project requires functionality to download and manage web pages. This involves creating a system that can fetch web content, store it, and provide management capabilities. The implementation needs to be scalable, maintainable, and follow the established Clean Architecture patterns.

## Decision

Implement web page functionality using a domain-driven approach with separate aggregates for WebPage and Contributor entities. Use CQRS pattern for separating read and write operations, and implement proper event handling for domain events.

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- **Clear separation of concerns** through domain aggregates
- **Scalable architecture** that can handle multiple web page operations
- **Event-driven design** enables loose coupling and extensibility
- **CQRS pattern** provides optimal performance for read and write operations

**Negative outcomes:**
- Increased complexity compared to a simple CRUD approach
- More initial development time required
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with DDD patterns

**Follow-up tasks:**
- Implement WebPage aggregate with domain events
- Create CQRS handlers for commands and queries
- Set up event handlers for domain events
- Add validation and error handling

## Alternatives Considered

- **Simple CRUD approach** – Would be faster to implement but less scalable
- **Monolithic service approach** – Would violate Clean Architecture principles
- **Event sourcing** – Considered but rejected due to complexity for current requirements
