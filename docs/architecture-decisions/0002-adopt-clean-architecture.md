# 0002: Adopt Clean Architecture

Status: Proposed

## Context

The project needs a structure that promotes maintainability, testability, and clear separation between business logic and external concerns. Clean Architecture organizes the codebase into distinct layers, isolating domain models from frameworks or infrastructure. This layered approach makes it easier to reason about dependencies and to evolve the system over time.

## Decision

Adopt the Clean Architecture pattern by structuring the solution into Core, UseCases, Infrastructure, and Web layers. Each layer will depend only on the layers below it, enforcing strict separation of concerns.

## Consequences

- **Improved maintainability** through a well-defined layering strategy.
- **Easier testing** because business logic can be exercised without infrastructure dependencies.
- **Flexibility** to replace frameworks or external services without impacting the domain model.

## Alternatives Considered

- Continue with a monolithic project structure, which would make dependencies and testing more difficult.
